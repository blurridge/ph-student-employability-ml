# Predicting Filipino Students' Employability Based on Mock Interview Results

## Context
First time implementing machine learning models into my project. I used the 
[Students' Employability Dataset - Philippines Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anashamoutni/students-employability-dataset) for this project.

## Prerequisites
The project uses three libraries which is pandas, matplotlib, and Seaborn.
```
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install scikit-learn
```

## Questions asked during the project
1. Which characteristic do Filipino students score low in? high in?
2. What is the usual cutoff average score for employability according to the dataset?
3. Which feature has the greatest correlation with employability?
4. Which classifier model has the highest accuracy for this dataset? Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors Classification, or Support Vector Machines?
